Changes in Version 4
- Sources adapted for LilyGO TTGO T3 LoRa32 board (10dB better radio performance)
- Sources adapted for VC PlatformIO (arduino IDE support not tested)
- During a TTN connect phase, the I2S MEMS driver is stopped, because it gives Rx radio interference
- The update of the OLED display is moved from the sound thread to the main thread.

Changes in Version 3
- Test report added
- MCCI Catena LoRa stack
- Worker loop changed (hang situation solved with TTN V3)
- OLED display added
- DEVEUI obtained from BoardID, (same SW for multiple sensors)
- use the TWO processor cores of ESP (one core for audio and one core for LoRa)
- DC offset MEMS compensated by moving average window
- payload compressed from 27 to 19 bytes

Changes in Version 2
- update Readme, TTGO added, pinning diagram for different configurations, interface changed
- config.h, contains all relevant parameters
- SoundSensor class added, and lorasoundkit.ino cleaned
- bin size is changed form 22Hz to 11Hz, mems buffer is changed from 1K to 2K
- update class measurement, avg based on energy, peak is changed to max. and min, added
- Lora timeout added
- Lora downlink changed to one receivehandler callback call
- payload decoder changed, LA and LC calculated from LZ (use Lora port 21)

Changes in Version 2.1
- platformio.ini added for platformio environment (thanks Bertrik)
- OLED display enabled for TTGO (added files oled.cpp and lora.h)
- LMIC library changed from Matthys Kooijman to MCCI-Catena (better maintained)
- lora.cpp and lora.h adapted
